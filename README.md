### Setup

The setup process is described in lengthy detail [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). The fast way to setup a new project is the following:

~~~`javascript
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
~~~

The dev server can be spinned up by doing `npm start`. This is starts whatever is noted in package.json under Start. A lot of files are generated. The entry point is in `src/inedx.js`.
